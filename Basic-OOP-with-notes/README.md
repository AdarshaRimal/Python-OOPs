# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each script showcases fundamental principles like **classes and objects**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **method overriding**, **multiple inheritance**, **composition**, and **method resolution order (MRO)**.

## Contents

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
- Explains the concept of creating classes and objects.
- Demonstrates how to instantiate objects and access their attributes and methods.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
- Introduction to encapsulation, demonstrating how to restrict direct access to class attributes.
- Usage of private and protected attributes with getter and setter methods.

### 3. **Inheritance**
- Shows how inheritance works in Python, allowing one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- Includes examples of both single and multiple inheritance.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
- Demonstrates polymorphism, where methods in different classes can have the same name but behave differently depending on the object.
- Includes method overriding, where child classes provide their own implementation of a method.

### 5. **Method Overriding**
- Shows how subclasses can override methods defined in parent classes to change or extend behavior.
- An example where a subclass method overrides the method of a superclass.

### 6. **Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)**
- Demonstrates multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.
- Discusses Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO) and how it resolves method lookup in the case of multiple inheritance.

### 7. **Composition**
- Composition, which models a "has-a" relationship where one class contains objects of another class.
- Explains how composition avoids the complexities of multiple inheritance by allowing one class to use the functionality of other classes through object attributes.

## How to Use

Each folder or script contains a specific OOP concept, with clear comments and structured examples. These scripts are useful for revision and study purposes, making it easier to review key OOP principles.

Feel free to browse the code and use it as a reference or for learning OOP in Python.
